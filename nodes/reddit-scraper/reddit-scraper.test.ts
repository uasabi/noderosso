When you use a VPN, you are asking a third party to route your packets, which costs money, as well as take on any liability for any actions you take while connected to the VPN (liability = money), and you are asking them to act always in your benefit and be trustworthy. That doesn't come free. Many VPN providers offer service for less than $5/mo and that's a bargain considering what you're asking from them when you intend to torrent on them. I won't recommend any particular service. I'll let you do your own research. But I'll tell you that any \"free\" service is not something you want to connect to.</p>\n</div>",

(E.g. making a wireguard or openvpn server and/or a socks5 proxy into clusterip service that any pod can use. I'm envisioning a setup where you could build on it to make like \"every pod in X namespace is behind this VPN, or behind Tor\" or something like that. Or is that just dumb and there's some easy way to share pod networks that I'm not aware of?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my torrenting client of choice is qbittorrent, because it's very easy to configure it via a config file to only use one network device / source IP address / etc, and/or to use a socks proxy. You can also of course just have it be in the same pod as a VPN connection, and use other security context stuff to isolate the containers in every way except networking. But it seems cleaner just to have the ability to make a shared network via operator or chart like I mentioned above.</p>\n</div>",

I'd think getting all these bits interconnected is difficult and maybe a operator will assist. But from what I understand you can't remove a operator after that setup is done, so wouldn't it be better to use something like helm instead of a operator in this case. If you wanted to setup a media service regularly like a saas offering I'd see it's use. Or was this simply a exercise in understanding the sdk that you wished to share, which is cool too. Again mean no offence and projects like this allow people to learn from each other so I think they are great.</p>\n</div>",
